  As part of my Project Bootcamp, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the Olist Store dataset, utilizing my expertise in Excel, Power BI, SQL, and Tableau to derive meaningful insights. The dataset consisted of nine CSV files covering various aspects of e-commerce transactions.

Key Analyses & Insights:
- Weekday vs. Weekend Sales Trends (order purchase timestamps).
- Payment Statistics – Identifying trends in payment types and consumer preferences.
- Customer Satisfaction Analysis – Filtering orders with a review score of 5 and payment made via credit card.
- Delivery Performance Evaluation – Measuring the average delivery time for pet shop orders.
- City-Specific Customer Insights – Analyzing average order prices and payment values in São Paulo.
- Shipping Efficiency vs. Customer Reviews – Examining the impact of delivery speed on customer satisfaction.

This project strengthened my data manipulation, visualization, and data cleaning, enabling me to transform raw data into actionable business insights for strategic decision-making.
